# EvoNote Future Roadmap & Feature Proposal 🚀

As a modern, bidirectional-link note-taking application, EvoNote has established a strong "Microkernel" foundation. To compete with top-tier tools like Obsidian, Logseq, or Roam Research, I recommend the following feature roadmap, prioritized by user impact.

## 1. 👁️ Live Preview (wysiwyg)
**The "Killer Feature".**
Currently, EvoNote displays raw Markdown (e.g., `**bold**`, `[[link]]`). Modern users expect a hybrid editor:
- **Behavior**: Markdown syntax is hidden when not editing a line. `**bold**` renders as **bold** immediately. `[[link]]` looks like a blue link.
- **Value**: Reduces visual clutter. Makes writing feel like "thinking" rather than "coding".

## 2. 🕸️ Knowledge Graph (Graph View)
**Visualizing Connections.**
- **Feature**: A 2D/3D force-directed graph showing all notes as dots and links as lines.
- **Value**: Helps users discover "clusters" of thought and navigate their digital brain organically.
- **Tech**: Use `PySide6.QtWebEngineWidgets` to embed a D3.js or Cytoscape.js graph.

## 3. ⌨️ Command Palette (Ctrl+P)
**Keyboard-First Navigation.**
- **Feature**: A popup input box to:
    - Open any file (fuzzy match).
    - Run commands ("Toggle Dark Mode", "Split View", "Insert Date").
- **Value**: Speed. Users never need to touch the mouse.

## 4. 📅 Daily Notes & Templates
**Journaling Workflow.**
- **Feature**: One click to open today's note (e.g., `2025-12-16.md`). Support for `{{date}}` templates.
- **Value**: Frictionless entry for daily logging.

## 5. 🏷️ Tag System
**Cross-Link Organization.**
- **Feature**: Support `#tags` which are indexed separately from links.
- **Value**: Organizing by topic (e.g., `#project`, `#todo`) across folders.

## 6. 🖼️ Canvas (Infinite Whiteboard)
**Visual Thinking.**
- **Feature**: An infinite canvas to drag-and-drop notes, images, and connect them with arrows (like Heptabase/Obsidian Canvas).
- **Value**: High-level brainstorming and restructuring.

### 💡 Recommendation for V0.5.0
Focus 100% on **Live Preview**. It is the single most visible improvement that upgrades the "feel" of the app from "Text Editor" to "Note App".
